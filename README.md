# `runjs`

Code for the Roll your own JavaScript runtime blog post series

- [Roll your own JavaScript runtime](https://deno.com/blog/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime)
- [Roll your own JavaScript runtime, pt. 2](https://deno.com/blog/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime-pt2)
- [Roll your own JavaScript runtime, pt. 3](https://deno.com/blog/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime-pt3)

The official repository for the blog post series is [denoland/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime](https://github.com/denoland/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime) but it's outdated and doesn't work with the latest Deno versions(=0.272.0). So I've created this repository to make it work with the latest Deno versions.

## Usage

`pt{1,2,3}` branches contain the code for the respective blog post part.
